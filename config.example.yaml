# Pulse Configuration Example
# Copy this file to config.yaml and adjust as needed

# API Server configuration
server:
  address: ":8080"          # API server bind address
  enable_tui: true          # Run TUI (false for headless/API-only mode)

# Global probe settings
global:
  interval: 10s             # Probe interval
  timeout: 5s               # Probe timeout
  pings: 20                 # Number of probes per interval (SmokePing-style burst)
  data_dir: ./data          # Directory for RRD database files

# Storage retention policy (RRD format)
# Format: "resolution:duration" - comma separated for multiple archives
# Examples:
#   10s:1d   = 10 second resolution, keep 1 day
#   1m:7d    = 1 minute resolution, keep 7 days
#   1h:90d   = 1 hour resolution, keep 90 days
storage:
  retention: "10s:1d,1m:7d,1h:90d"
  aggregation: average      # average, min, max, last
  xff: 0.5                  # xFilesFactor (0.0-1.0)
